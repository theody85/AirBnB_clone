# AirBnB clone - The console

The console is the first part of the **AirBnB clone** project which aims to deploy a simple copy of the AirBnB website to cover all fundamental concepts of the ALX School higher level programming track.  

## Overview

This first and starting of the project focuses on creating a command interpreter that allows to:  
- create the data model.  
- manage (create, update and destroy) objects via a console.  
- store and persist objects to a file (JSON file).  


## Files and Directories

**`/models`** directory constains all classes used for the project.  
[basemodel.py](https://github.com/McDevin619/AirBnB_clone/models/base_model.py) file contains the base class (**BaseModel**) of all models in the project:  
- [user.py](https://github.com/McDevin6193/AirBnB_clone/models/user.py) - file contains the `User` class.  
- [state.py](https://github.com/McDevin619/AirBnB_clone/models/state.py) - file contains the `State` class.  
- [city.py](https://github.com/McDevin619/AirBnB_clone/models/city.py) - file contains the `City`class.  
- [amenity.py](https://github.com/McDevin619/AirBnB_clone/models/amenity.py) - file contains the `Amenity` class.  
- [place.py](https://github.com/McDevin619/AirBnB_clone/models/place.py) - file contains the `Place` class.  
- [review.py](https://github.com/McDevin619/AirBnB_clone/models/review.py) - file contains the `Review` class.  

**`/models/engine`** directory contains the class that handles JSON serialization and deserialization.  
[file_storage.py](https://github.com/Blessingdev233/AirBnB_clone/blob/main/models/engine/file_storage.py) - file contains `FileStorage` class.  

**`/tests`** directory contains all unit test cases for this project.  

[console.py](https://github.com/Blessingdev233/AirBnB_clone/blob/main/console.py) the console contains the entry point of the command interpreter.

## Environment and Execution

This project was interpreted/compiled and tested on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using python3 (version 3.8.5).  

To use the console you must have `python3` installed and the repository cloned  
(`git clone https://github.com/Blessingdev233/AirBnB_clone.git`).  

To start the console you only need to run `./console` in the root of the repository.  

The console works like this in interactive mode:

```
$ ./console.py
(hbnb) help

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit

(hbnb) 
(hbnb) 
(hbnb) quit
$

```

But also in non-interactive mode: (like the [Shell project](https://github.com/Kwapee/simple_shell) in C)

```
$ echo "help" | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
$ cat test_help
help
$
$ cat test_help | ./console.py
(hbnb)

Documented commands (type help <topic>):
========================================
EOF  help  quit
(hbnb) 
$
```
